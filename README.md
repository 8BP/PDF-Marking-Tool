PDF-Marking-Tool
================

A solution for PDF-based on-screen marking of assignments, tests, etc. Used by a number of universities in South Africa

This project was forked from the "Unisa Tool for Onscreen Marking". This fork will retain the purpose of the original UTOM, but may choose to add additional capabilities to make the solution applicable to a wider user base.

The project is available under the GPL v2 licence.

Please ensure that all distributions of the code clearly acknowledges the role of the University of South Africa, ideally with a link to the project's original home at http://www.unisa.ac.za/Default.asp?Cmd=ViewContent&ContentID=23049
